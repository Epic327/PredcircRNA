# PredcircRNA: computational classification of circular RNA from other long non-coding RNA using hybrid features

PredcircRNA, focused on distinguishing circularRNA from other lncRNAs using  
multiple kernel learning. Firstly we extracted different sources of discriminative features, including graph feature, conservation information and sequence 
compositions, ALU and tandem repeat, SNP density and open reading frame (ORF) from transcripts. Secondly, to better integrate features from different sources, we 
proposed a computational approach based on multiple kernel learning framework to fuse those heterogeneous features.
